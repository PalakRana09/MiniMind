##  How It Works

1. **Predefined Q&A Dataset**  
   A small set of predefined questions and answers form the chatbot's knowledge base.

2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**  
   Each question is converted into a numerical vector using TF-IDF.

3. **Cosine Similarity**  
   User input is compared to all questions. The most similar one is selected.

4. **Interactive Chat**  
   Gradio provides a smooth, real-time chat interface for interaction.
